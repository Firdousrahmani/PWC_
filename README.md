As part of the PwC Virtual Internship program, I had the opportunity to work on a real-world business scenario focused on enhancing operational 
visibility within a call center environment using Power BI.

The task was to analyze and visualize key call center metrics and trends to support data-driven decision-making. I developed a comprehensive Power BI
dashboard tailored to the business needs of the call center management team.

**Key insights I delivered through the dashboard:**

- Tracked overall customer satisfaction ratings and trends
- Visualized hourly and monthly call volumes (answered vs abandoned) to identify peak periods and service gaps
- Measured average speed of answer to assess operational responsiveness
- Analyzed agent performance through a quadrant view of average handle time versus the number of calls handled
- Provided a breakdown of agent-level metrics to help management identify strengths and improvement areas
